Body for the GitHub Release, passed to softprops/action-gh-release as
`body_path` in .github/workflows/electron.yml.

It exists because the release body is otherwise whatever
`generate_release_notes` produces, so recutting a tag silently replaced
hand-written notes with a bare "What's Changed" list. Keep this file in step
with the version being tagged; the generated PR list is appended below it
automatically, so do not paste one here.

## What's new in 3.0.1

**PDF features work in the desktop app and in more browsers.** In 3.0.0, converting a PDF to an image or to text, and the PDF Editor's page previews, failed in the desktop app and on Safari before 26.2, Chrome and Edge before 145, and Samsung Internet: the PDF library relied on JavaScript features those engines do not have yet, and the desktop app's engine is one version short of them. The app now loads the library's build that runs everywhere.

**The PDF Editor keeps track of your pages.** After Clear and a second PDF, picking page 9 could show "273" in the Pages field and make Extract fail with "The PDF might be damaged". The same mix-up could move a selection onto the wrong pages, lose pages in a multi-page drag, put a thumbnail on the wrong page, and let undo bring back a removed file or duplicate its pages. Extract now also keeps the rotations you set in Organize, as Export already did.

**A finished conversion no longer leaves a session that cannot be restored.** Picking another target format after a conversion made every later reload report "Saved session was incomplete", and emptying the workspace offered to "Resume 0 files".

## About frogConvert

frogConvert is a universal file converter, compressor and PDF editor that runs entirely in your browser. Convert between 70+ formats, compress images, audio, video and PDFs, or edit PDFs, all without a single byte leaving your machine, and drive the same engine from AI agents and scripts through the MCP server or the local REST API.

### Convert anything to anything
- 70+ file formats across images, audio, video, documents and more.
- A routing engine (shortest path over the format graph) chains conversions automatically, so it can get from A to B even when there is no direct converter, picking the best route for you.

### Compress without losing what matters
- A dedicated Compress mode for images, audio, video and PDFs, with per-file savings shown before you download.
- Real PDF compression via Ghostscript-WASM: text stays text, not rasterized into an image.
- Never worse: a re-encode that saves less than 2% is discarded and you keep the original.

### Built-in PDF editor
- Merge, reorder, extract pages, and watermark PDFs, all in the same tool.

### Private by design
- Everything runs client-side in the browser. Files are never uploaded to a server, so nothing is stored, logged, or sent anywhere.

### For agents and scripts
- MCP server: clone the repo and run `bun run mcp`, exposing conversion, compression and PDF editing as tools to AI agents.
- Local REST API: `bun run api`, the same engine behind a simple HTTP interface for scripts and automation.

### Run it your way
- Use it in the browser, self-host it, run it in Docker, or build it as a desktop app.

### Built on
- TypeScript, Vite, and a Vitest + Puppeteer test suite.
- Ghostscript, ImageMagick, FFmpeg, Pandoc, pdf-lib and pdf.js do the heavy lifting; the full list is in the README.
- A fork of "Convert to it!" by p2r3, whose conversion pipeline frogConvert inherits and builds on. **Compress and the PDF editor are frogConvert originals**, neither exists upstream, as are the MCP server, the REST API and the test suite.

### No warranty
frogConvert is provided as is, with no warranty and no security audit. See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/ogfrench/frogConvert/blob/master/SECURITY.md).
