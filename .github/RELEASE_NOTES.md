Body for the GitHub Release, passed to softprops/action-gh-release as

It exists because the release body is otherwise whatever
`generate_release_notes` produces, so recutting a tag silently replaced
hand-written notes with a bare "What's Changed" list. Keep this file in step

automatically, so do not paste one here.

## What's new in 3.1.0

**Exact Office to PDF in your browser.** On a computer, the Converter now offers to download an Office engine once (about 74 MB). After that, Word, PowerPoint, Excel and OpenDocument files become real PDFs with selectable text, one page per slide, in a few seconds. It stays on your device and nothing is uploaded. Phones keep the old behaviour: a PDF made of pictures, labelled as such. The engine can occasionally stall on a document; frogConvert stops it after a few seconds and tries again on a fresh one, and if that fails too you still get the picture PDF.

**CSV to SQLite works with any file name.** A file called `table.csv` failed, every value lost its first character, and names with spaces or SQL keywords broke the conversion. Fixed, and SQLite to CSV now quotes values properly.

**Cross-origin isolation.** The site now sends the headers that let the engine run, with no change you will notice elsewhere.

For everything new in 3.0, see the [3.0.0 release](https://github.com/ogfrench/frogConvert/releases/tag/v3.0.0). Full history in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ogfrench/frogConvert/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## About frogConvert

frogConvert is a universal file converter, compressor and PDF editor that runs entirely in your browser. Convert between 70+ formats, compress images, audio, video and PDFs, or edit PDFs, all without a single byte leaving your machine, and drive the same engine from AI agents and scripts through the MCP server or the local REST API.

### Convert anything to anything
- 70+ file formats across images, audio, video, documents and more.
- A routing engine (shortest path over the format graph) chains conversions automatically, so it can get from A to B even when there is no direct converter, picking the best route for you.

### Compress without losing what matters
- A dedicated Compress mode for images, audio, video and PDFs, with per-file savings shown before you download.
- Real PDF compression via Ghostscript-WASM: text stays text, not rasterized into an image.
- Never worse: a re-encode that saves less than 2% is discarded and you keep the original.

### Built-in PDF editor
- Merge, reorder, extract pages, and watermark PDFs, all in the same tool.

### Private by design
- Everything runs client-side in the browser. Files are never uploaded to a server, so nothing is stored, logged, or sent anywhere.

### For agents and scripts
- MCP server: clone the repo and run `bun run mcp`, exposing conversion, compression and PDF editing as tools to AI agents.
- Local REST API: `bun run api`, the same engine behind a simple HTTP interface for scripts and automation.

### Run it your way
- Use it in the browser, self-host it, run it in Docker, or build it as a desktop app.

### Built on
- TypeScript, Vite, and a Vitest + Puppeteer test suite.
- Ghostscript, ImageMagick, FFmpeg, Pandoc, pdf-lib and pdf.js do the heavy lifting; the full list is in the README.
- A fork of "Convert to it!" by p2r3, whose conversion pipeline frogConvert inherits and builds on. **Compress and the PDF editor are frogConvert originals**, neither exists upstream, as are the MCP server, the REST API and the test suite.

### No warranty
frogConvert is provided as is, with no warranty and no security audit. See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/ogfrench/frogConvert/blob/master/SECURITY.md).
