<!--
Body for the GitHub Release, passed to softprops/action-gh-release as
`body_path` in .github/workflows/electron.yml.

It exists because the release body is otherwise whatever
`generate_release_notes` produces, so recutting a tag silently replaced
hand-written notes with a bare "What's Changed" list. Keep this file in step
with the version being tagged; the generated PR list is appended below it
automatically, so do not paste one here.

## What's new in 3.1.5

**Electron security.** Updated the desktop runtime to Electron 44.9.3, addressing 13 reported GitHub Dependabot advisories in the previous 40.x series.

**Build stability.** Fixed intermittent macOS Electron builds running out of Node heap, and made LibreOffice conversion verification use a consistent Linux runner with network retries and a bounded installation step.

**Dependency compatibility.** Updated the dependency group and adjusted TMX XML typing and ImageMagick WASM asset loading for updated packages.

This is a maintenance release. Full history is available in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ogfrench/frogConvert/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## About frogConvert

frogConvert is a universal file converter, compressor and PDF editor that runs entirely in your browser. Convert between 70+ formats, compress images, audio, video and PDFs, or edit PDFs, all without a single byte leaving your machine, and drive the same engine from AI agents and scripts through the MCP server or the local REST API.

### Convert anything to anything
- 70+ file formats across images, audio, video, documents and more.
- A routing engine (shortest path over the format graph) chains conversions automatically, so it can get from A to B even when there is no direct converter, picking the best route for you.

### Compress without losing what matters
- A dedicated Compress mode for images, audio, video and PDFs, with per-file savings shown before you download.
- Real PDF compression via Ghostscript-WASM: text stays text, not rasterized into an image.
- Never worse: a re-encode that saves less than 2% is discarded and you keep the original.

### Built-in PDF editor
- Merge, reorder, extract pages, and watermark PDFs, all in the same tool.

### Private by design
- Everything runs client-side in the browser. Files are never uploaded to a server, so nothing is stored, logged, or sent anywhere.

### For agents and scripts
- MCP server: clone the repo and run `bun run mcp`, exposing conversion, compression and PDF editing as tools to AI agents.
- Local REST API: `bun run api`, the same engine behind a simple HTTP interface for scripts and automation.

### Run it your way
- Use it in the browser, self-host it, run it in Docker, or build it as a desktop app.

### Built on
- TypeScript, Vite, and a Vitest + Puppeteer test suite.
- Ghostscript, ImageMagick, FFmpeg, Pandoc, pdf-lib and pdf.js do the heavy lifting; the full list is in the README.
- A fork of "Convert to it!" by p2r3, whose conversion pipeline frogConvert inherits and builds on. **Compress and the PDF editor are frogConvert originals**, neither exists upstream, as are the MCP server, the REST API and the test suite.

### No warranty
frogConvert is provided as is, with no warranty and no security audit. See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/ogfrench/frogConvert/blob/master/SECURITY.md).
