It exists because the release body is otherwise whatever
`generate_release_notes` produces, so recutting a tag silently replaced
hand-written notes with a bare "What's Changed" list. Keep this file in step

## What's new in 3.2.1

**Same app as 3.2.0, safer releases.** This release changes how frogConvert is published, not what it does. A release now goes out only after every test has passed on that exact build, and appears only once the Windows, macOS and Linux downloads are all attached, so you never land on a release page with a file missing. The build tools are pinned, so each release is made with exactly what was tested.

If you already have 3.2.0 there is nothing new to try; the faster video and quicker start-up from [3.2.0](https://github.com/ogfrench/frogConvert/releases/tag/v3.2.0) are all here.

Full history in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ogfrench/frogConvert/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## About frogConvert

frogConvert is a universal file converter, compressor and PDF editor that runs entirely in your browser. Convert between 70+ formats, compress images, audio, video and PDFs, or edit PDFs, all without a single byte leaving your machine, and drive the same engine from AI agents and scripts through the MCP server or the local REST API.

### Convert anything to anything
- 70+ file formats across images, audio, video, documents and more.
- A routing engine (shortest path over the format graph) chains conversions automatically, so it can get from A to B even when there is no direct converter, picking the best route for you.

### Compress without losing what matters
- A dedicated Compress mode for images, audio, video and PDFs, with per-file savings shown before you download.
- Real PDF compression via Ghostscript-WASM: text stays text, not rasterized into an image.
- Never worse: a re-encode that saves less than 2% is discarded and you keep the original.

### Built-in PDF editor
- Merge, reorder, extract pages, and watermark PDFs, all in the same tool.

### Private by design
- Everything runs client-side in the browser. Files are never uploaded to a server, so nothing is stored, logged, or sent anywhere.

### For agents and scripts
- MCP server: clone the repo and run `bun run mcp`, exposing conversion, compression and PDF editing as tools to AI agents.
- Local REST API: `bun run api`, the same engine behind a simple HTTP interface for scripts and automation.

### Run it your way
- Use it in the browser, self-host it, run it in Docker, or build it as a desktop app.

### Built on
- TypeScript, Vite, and a Vitest + Puppeteer test suite.
- Ghostscript, ImageMagick, FFmpeg, Pandoc, pdf-lib and pdf.js do the heavy lifting; the full list is in the README.
- A fork of "Convert to it!" by p2r3, whose conversion pipeline frogConvert inherits and builds on. **Compress and the PDF editor are frogConvert originals**, neither exists upstream, as are the MCP server, the REST API and the test suite.

### No warranty
frogConvert is provided as is, with no warranty and no security audit. See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/ogfrench/frogConvert/blob/master/SECURITY.md).
